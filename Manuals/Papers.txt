Brain Waves: Several articles in https://www.sciencedirect.com/ 	Search for each type of wave (alpha,beta,etc), mostly to understand and get an intro to them.
Additionally, chack wikipedia to get the simplest introduction to brain waves.

Bos Paper:

Valence: positive, happy emotions result in a higher
frontal coherence in alpha, and higher right parietal
beta power, compared to negative emotion.

Arousal: excitation presented a higher beta power and
coherence in the parietal lobe, plus lower alpha activity.

Dominance: strength of an emotion, which is generally
expressed in the EEG as an increase in the beta / alpha
activity ratio in the frontal lobe, plus an increase in
beta activity at the parietal lobe.
