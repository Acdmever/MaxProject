Intructions for use of Senso Gloves

By Luis Cordero (lacordero@dal.ca)


Installing gloves drivers:
1.Make sure to download the driver from senso.me/dev (Currently Windows is the only OS able to run this)
2.Insert one of the USB drives, then run "zadig" from the driver.
3.In zadig, click Options and List All Devices.
4.Choose CSR8510 A10 (USB Driver for Gloves), Replace Driver.

Running:

1.If gloves are charged, choose "run.cmd" from the dowloaded driver.
2.Gloves should be running from this point.
3.Make sure to calibrate gloves.

To charge gloves, just connect them to the computer. They will not be recognized by the computer, but they will charge.

Using with Unity:

-Make sure to download the Plugin from senso.me/dev and import the asset to the project.

-Check my example on how to use the built in vibration.

Classes: 
EPositionType is an enum: Unknown, RightHand, LeftHand, Body, PositionsCount. You can use these in order to get which device you are using.
EFingerType is an enum as well: Thumb, Index, Middle, Third, Little. This is used to specify wich finger to vibrate.

Functions:
VibrateFinger(Senso.EFingerType finger, ushort duration, byte strength): Comes from Hand.cs, based on SendVibro(Senso.EPositionType handType, Senso.EFingerType finger, ushort duration, byte strength) from SensoHandsController.cs. This will vibrate the glove that the script is attatched to in Unity.
