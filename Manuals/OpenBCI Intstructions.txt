By Luis Cordero (lacordero@dal.ca)

Install instructions:

Before starting, check if the drivers for the dongle are installed (IE the dongle is recognized when connected). If not, download them from https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm 
Additionally, make sure you have git and node.js installed.

Installing instructions:

1. We first need to have OpenBCI Hub. Open Git Bash.
2. Go to the directory where you want the OpenBCI software to be installed in.
3. git clone https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_Ganglion_Electron.git
4. cd OpenBCI_Ganglion_Electron
5. npm install
6. npm install electron-prebuilt -g
7. Then, we need to download OpenBCI GUI. Download it from  https://openbci.com/index.php/downloads .

With this, we have all the required software installed and downloaded.

Running instructions. Make sure the dongle is connected.
Hub:
1.Open Git Bash
2.Go to the directory the Hub was installed. E.g. Documents/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_Ganglion_Electron
3.npm start
4. Sometimes, it might seem like it did not work because of a javascript error, but it is working. Close the error window and keep Bash open.

2.Click "Live from Cyton"
3."Using the serial Dongle". 
4.Select port COM3 , 16 channels
5."Start"
6."Start data streaming" on the top left, don't forget to turn on the headwear, there is a little switch on the right side of the board in the headwear. From here the OpenBCI_GUI should be fully functional.
